### Manipulations

As with all data pertaining the countries, there are specific inclusions, exclusions, innacuracies and manipulations that are made. Missing data from some sources are repaired or substituded to the best of my ability. If two countries have the same value for a catagory, **the one first alphabetically has the better rank** (I have tried to avoid scenarios like this). The average elevation data is also quite suspect, in future I might try to produce my own dataset.
